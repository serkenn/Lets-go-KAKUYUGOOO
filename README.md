Install: 
    0: Install GSAF graphic library, Before installing TASK
          tar xvzf gsaf-yyyymmdd.tar.gz
	  cd gsaf/sc
	  cp ../arch/XXXXXXX/Makefile.arch
	  make
	  make install
    1: Expand tar.gz file
          tar xvzf task-yyyymmdd.tar.gz
          tar xvzf bpsd-yyyymmdd.tar.gz
    2: Move to task directory
          cd task
    3: Create make.header
          cp make.header.org make.header
    4: Edit make.header
          Remove "#" of the first column of appropiate section
          Set the location of graphic libraries.
          If you have Lapack library, change "#"s.
          If you have MDSplus library, change "#"s.
    5: Make common library
          cd lib
          make
          cd ..
    6: Make bpsd library
          cd ../bpsd
          make
          cd ../task
    7: Make appropriate module
          cd tot [for example]
          make
          ./tot [for example]

Update:
    If you change a source file in the present module, 
        "make" again.
    If you change a source file in the other module, 
        you need to "make libs"
    If you change settings in a Makefile or make.header, 
        you need to "make clean" and "make" again.

Standard input command:
    V: view input parameters
    R: run the calculation
    C: continue the calculation
    G: graphic mode
         commands in graphic mode (see documents of the module)
         X: exit graphic command
    S: save present calculation data
    L: load saved calculation data
    Q: quit execution

Input parameters:
    1. Definitions and default values of input parameters are
       described in XXinit.f.  Most of common input parameters 
       are given in plx/plinit.f.  We do not recommend you to 
       modify XXinit.f.  You had better to use XXparm file 
       described in the next item instead.
    2. You can set standard input parameters in a text file 
       XXparm located at the working directory.  The format
       of XXparm file is the fortran namelist input.
    3. You can change the input parameters on the input command 
       line.  A input line including a character "=", e.g. 
       "RR=6.2", is recognized as a part of namelist input.

Compile parameters:
       The size of arrays are usually defined in XXcom0.inc.
       For large scale calculation, you may need to increase 
       the numbers in XXcom0.inc and "make" again.
